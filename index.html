        The survival of organisations is dependent on their ability to quickly adapt to the macroeconomic environment 
        (global, market and industry changes). Gaining strategic intelligence on globalisation, socio-economic issues, 
        countries and relevant topics and trends are key to gaining a competitive advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failing to do so, drives organisations to failure or extinction.Although having this intelligence at hand is the first step, 
        connecting all the dots and taking the right action is what differentiates those that adapt and remain at the forefront 
        of their field.

        Organisations set a clear direction through strategic goals and objectives. However, many fail to execute on their high-level 
        strategies. These failures are the manifestation of complex strategic frameworks that are difficult to understand and implement 
        in practice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, at the centre of the success of any strategy is people and change. If people donâ€™t understand the change you want them to make, 
        they will not support your strategy and will be reluctant to change.
